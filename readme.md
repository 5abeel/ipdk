  Infrastructure Programmer Development Kit (IPDK) is an open source, vendor agnostic framework of drivers and APIs for infrastructure offload and management that runs on a CPU, IPU, DPU or switch. IPDK runs in Linux and uses a set of well-established tools such as SPDK, DPDK and P4 to enable network virtualization, storage virtualization, workload provisioning, root-of-trust and offload capabilities found in the platform. IPDK provides a common platform for increasing performance, optimizing resources and securing the infrastructure as an open source community.<br>
