Prerequisites:
- P4-OVS container is up and running. 
- Two independent VMs are up and running on the host machine/server.
  Its recommeded to look at 'VM Setup' section below.

VM Setup:
Pre-requisite: Pre-build VM image.
- This involves below steps:
  1. Start VMs - One can use helper scripts 'start_vm.sh' provided in this example folder.
     Check for Mountpoint directory with 'docker volume inspect shared' on host
     machine/server and use this directory in 'path' field of the qemu-kvm.
  2. Configure IP address and ARP entry on each VM.

Configuration Details:
a) Add a virtual port vA to say VM A.
b) Add a virtual port vB to say VM B.
c) Put vA and vB into a virtual bridge in P4-OVS container using vhost-user interface.
d) Ping and/or send traffic sucessfully between VM A & VM B.

P4 Program:
- Helper p4 program and supporting files can be found in 'simple_l3' folder.

                     |Container| 
                     +---------+           




How to connect your VM to your P4-OVS container:
- Recommended way to do this is to create a shared volume between P4-OVS container and your VM. This can be done with 'docker create volume' command.
